# Testing Mathematical Concepts from the Question Creator's Perspective

## Instruction
If you were the question creator, what specific mathematical concepts would you like to test in the problem?

## Function
- Analyze the underlying intent of the math problem and identify the key mathematical concepts being tested.

## Suitable For
- Candidates who are unclear about what the problem is testing.
- Those who do not have an in-depth understanding of the mathematical concepts.
- Test-takers seeking to improve their problem-solving strategies by understanding the question creator’s perspective.
- Applicable to math-related problems in Q, DS, TPA, MSR.

## Example
**Input:**  
"A certain theater has 500 seats. Some are on the main floor and sell for \$50 each; some are in the first balcony and sell for \$45 each; and the rest are in the second balcony and sell for \$35 each. When all of the seats are sold for a performance, the gross revenue for that performance is \$20,900. Of the three seating areas, the second balcony has the most seats.

Select for First balcony a number of seats in this theater’s first balcony and select for Second balcony a number of seats in this theater’s second balcony such that the selections are jointly consistent with the information provided. Make only two selections, one in each column.

First balcony: [100, 150, 190, 210, 250, 300]  
Second balcony: [100, 150, 190, 210, 250, 300]"

**Output:**  
"If I were the question creator, I would like to test the following specific mathematical concepts:
1. Translation of word problems into algebraic equations.
2. Formation and solution of systems of linear equations.
3. Use of the substitution method to reduce the system to a single equation.
4. Simplification of algebraic expressions by combining like terms.
5. Application of inequality constraints to ensure that the second balcony has the most seats.
6. Logical reasoning to select the valid solution among the provided choices."
