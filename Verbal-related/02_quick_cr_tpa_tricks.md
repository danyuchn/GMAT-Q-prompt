# AI Instruction: Provide a Quick Solving Shortcut Within N Minutes

## Instruction
Please provide a shortcut method that enables a human to solve a problem quickly within N minutes. The principle is as follows:  
1. First, read the question and identify the key elements that unlock the problem.  
2. Next, tell me which parts of the passage are relevant information and which are not.  
3. Then, indicate whether to use a pre-writing (pre-answer drafting) strategy or an elimination strategy to answer the question.  
Each step must include a clear cue that leads to the next step and follow a linear, unidirectional human thought process.

**Note:** "N minutes" is variable depending on the problem type (e.g., CR: 2 minutes, TPA: 2.5-3 minutes).


## Function
- Offer a quick solving shortcut for CR and TPA verbal problems by optimizing the solving process through a linear reasoning approach.

## Suitable For
- Test takers who solve CR or TPA verbal problems slowly.
- Those unclear on how to quickly filter relevant information.
- Candidates needing advanced strategies and real exam practice.
- Test takers who wish to master either pre-writing or elimination techniques.

## Example

**Input:**  
"Of all cell phones in stock:
Most are sold at a discounted price if purchased with a new or renewed service contract.
More are dial pad phones (phones with integrated mechanical pads for entering numbers) than are touch screen-only phones (phones without integrated mechanical pads for entering numbers).

Of the dial pad phones:
Most have screens smaller than 8 centimeters (cm), measured diagonally.
Most are packaged with two or more accessories.

Of the touch screen-only phones:
Most have screens 8 cm or larger.
Most are packaged with two or more accessories.

Statement to be completed: Given the information regarding the cell phones in stock at the store, it follows that, of those that ___1___, fewer than half ___2___.

Based on the information provided, select for 1 and for 2 the options that most accurately complete the statement above. Make only two selections, one in each column.

**Output (Example):**  

**Step-by-Step Shortcut Method**

1. **Read & Identify Key Elements**  
   - **Cue:** Notice the two separate pieces of information: one about service contracts and phone types, and another about screen sizes and accessory packaging.  
   - **Relevant Info:**  
     - *Service Contract:* “Most are sold at a discounted price if purchased with a new or renewed service contract.”  
       → **Implication:** Phones purchased without a service contract form a minority.  
     - *Phone Type:* “More are dial pad phones than are touch screen-only phones.”  
       → **Implication:** Touch screen-only phones are fewer in number.
   - **Irrelevant Info:** Specific screen sizes (8 cm details) are extraneous for the accessory packaging conclusion.

2. **Determine the Property with “Most”**  
   - **Cue:** Look for a detail where “most” is mentioned and then deduce its logical complement.  
   - **Relevant Info:** Both dial pad and touch screen-only phones “most are packaged with two or more accessories.”  
     → **Deduction:** In any subgroup, fewer than half are packaged with fewer than two accessories.

3. **Decide on the Minority Subgroup (Blank 1)**  
   - **Cue:** Identify a group that is explicitly in the minority based on the passage.  
   - **Options:**  
     - *Are touch screen-only phones* → Minority (since dial pad phones outnumber them).  
     - *Are purchased without a service contract* → Also minority (because most phones come with a service contract).  
   - **Selection Rationale:** The accessory packaging info is given separately for each phone type, making “touch screen-only phones” more directly linked to the relevant detail.

4. **Select the Complementary Property (Blank 2)**  
   - **Cue:** Use the fact “most are packaged with two or more accessories” to determine its complement.  
   - **Conclusion:** Fewer than half are “packaged with fewer than two accessories.”

5. **Combine to Form the Complete Statement**  
   - **Result:**  
     - **Blank 1:** are touch screen-only phones  
     - **Blank 2:** are packaged with fewer than two accessories

**Final Answer:**  
Of those that *are touch screen-only phones*, fewer than half *are packaged with fewer than two accessories*."
