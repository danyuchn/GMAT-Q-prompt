# AI Instruction: Provide a Detailed Quick Solving Shortcut Within N Minutes

## Instruction
Please provide a shortcut method that enables a human to solve a problem quickly within N minutes. The method should follow these steps:  
1. First, identify the key information in the passage that needs attention (note: this should be done even when it is unclear what the question may test).  
2. Next, specify the keywords and main points for each question.  
3. Then, based on these keywords and points, indicate which related paragraphs in the passage are pertinent.  
4. After that, advise whether to use a pre-writing strategy or an elimination strategy to answer the question.  
5. If pre-writing is chosen, please detail the reasoning process step-by-step.  
Each step must provide a clear clue that leads to the next step and must follow a linear, unidirectional thought process. Also, provide a detailed explanation for the judgment on each option.

## Function
- Provide a quick solving shortcut for RC and MSR problems by using a linear reasoning process to sort out key points from the passage and their relationship to the questions, along with detailed option analysis.

## Suitable For
- Test takers with low reading and problem-solving efficiency in RC or MSR.
- Those who struggle to quickly pinpoint key points in the passage and relate them to the questions.
- Candidates needing advanced strategies for real exam scenarios.
- Test takers who wish to master detailed option analysis and pre-writing reasoning.

## Example
**Input:**  
"Industry's environmental improvement efforts have traditionally focused on pollution control through identifying, processing, and disposing of discharges or waste. Recently, more progressive companies have embraced the concept of pollution prevention, using such methods as material substitution and closed-loop processes to prevent pollution. Regardless of their approach to dealing with pollution, however, many companies view pollution treatment or control as too expensive. But companies must learn to view environmental improvement in terms of efficient use of resources and to recognize that pollution has “opportunity costs”—wasted resources, wasted effort, and diminished product value for customers.

This view of pollution as resulting from inefficient use of resources evokes the history of the “quality revolution” of the 1980s. Before that revolution, many managers believed that improving product quality was prohibitively expensive because it could be achieved only through additional inspections and reworking of “inevitable” product defects. What lay behind the old view was the assumption that both product design and production processes were unalterable. As a result of the quality revolution, companies now view defects as a sign of inefficient product and process design, not as an inevitable by-product of manufacturing.

Like product defects, industrial pollution often reveals flaws in product design or production processes. Companies can eliminate pollution and follow the basic principles of the quality revolution by using materials more efficiently, by obviating the need for hazardous and hard-to-handle materials, and by eliminating unneeded activities.

1. The term “opportunity costs” as it is used in the passage refers to which of the following?

(A) Costs to the consumer of new product development
(B) Financial ramifications of keeping pollution control costs low
(C) Opportunities to stop pollution before it begins
(D) Possibilities lost because of pollution
(E) Costs to industries of preventing pollution

**Output (Example):**  

### 1. Identify Key Information  
Clue: Read the passage carefully.  
Observation: The passage contrasts traditional pollution control with progressive pollution prevention, linking inefficient resource use to “opportunity costs”—explicitly defined as wasted resources, wasted effort, and diminished product value for customers.  
Action: Mark this definition as central to understanding the question.

### 2. Specify Keywords and Main Points  
Keywords: "Opportunity costs", "wasted resources", "wasted effort", "diminished product value", "inefficient use of resources".  
Main Point: Pollution represents lost opportunities in terms of resources and value, analogous to defects in product design as discussed in the quality revolution.  
Clue: These keywords help highlight the passage’s focus on losses incurred by inefficient processes.

### 3. Identify Pertinent Paragraphs  
Clue: Look for where the passage explains “opportunity costs”.  
Observation: The pertinent sentence is:  
"But companies must learn to view environmental improvement in terms of efficient use of resources and to recognize that pollution has 'opportunity costs'—wasted resources, wasted effort, and diminished product value for customers."  
Action: Focus on this section as it provides the definition required to answer the question.

### 4. Choose the Strategy: Elimination vs. Pre-Writing  
Decision: Use an elimination strategy to discard answer choices that do not match the definition.  
Reasoning Clue: Since the passage clearly defines opportunity costs as lost opportunities (waste) rather than specific financial outlays or costs incurred from prevention, eliminating alternatives that focus on financial or preventive cost issues is effective.

### 5. Detailed Pre-Writing Reasoning Process  
Step-by-Step Reasoning:  
Interpret the Definition:  
Recognize that “opportunity costs” are described as the losses incurred from inefficient resource usage.  
Relate to Options:  
Option (A): Costs to the consumer of new product development – Not supported; the passage does not discuss consumer costs for new development.  
Option (B): Financial ramifications of keeping pollution control costs low – Misleads by focusing on financial ramifications, which is not what the passage defines.  
Option (C): Opportunities to stop pollution before it begins – Irrelevant; the passage focuses on what is lost due to pollution, not the prevention opportunities.  
Option (D): Possibilities lost because of pollution – Matches the definition perfectly, reflecting wasted resources and diminished value.  
Option (E): Costs to industries of preventing pollution – Incorrect; the passage distinguishes between the expense of prevention and the losses from inefficiency.  
Conclude:  
The analysis confirms that Option (D) accurately encapsulates “opportunity costs” as the lost possibilities or benefits due to pollution.  

Thus, by following these systematic steps—identifying key details, extracting relevant keywords, focusing on the most pertinent paragraph, selecting an elimination strategy, and reasoning through each option—the answer is determined to be (D) Possibilities lost because of pollution.
