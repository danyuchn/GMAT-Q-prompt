# Identifying Features for Applying a Specific Solution

## Instruction
In future problem statements, what characteristics should be present to apply this particular solution method?

## Function
- Summarize the features of problem statements that make a specific solution method applicable, helping candidates to recognize patterns and apply methods effectively.

## Suitable For
- Test-takers who have difficulty identifying problem patterns.
- Candidates unsure about the scope of a solution method.
- Those looking to enhance their ability to adapt solution strategies.
- Applicable to math-related problems in Q, DS, TPA, MSR.

## Example
**Input:**  
"A certain theater has 500 seats. Some are on the main floor and sell for \$50 each; some are in the first balcony and sell for \$45 each; and the rest are in the second balcony and sell for \$35 each. When all of the seats are sold for a performance, the gross revenue for that performance is \$20,900. Of the three seating areas, the second balcony has the most seats.

Select for First balcony a number of seats in this theater’s first balcony and select for Second balcony a number of seats in this theater’s second balcony such that the selections are jointly consistent with the information provided. Make only two selections, one in each column.

First balcony: [100, 150, 190, 210, 250, 300]  
Second balcony: [100, 150, 190, 210, 250, 300]"

**Output:**  
"In future problem statements, to apply this particular solution method, the following characteristics should be present:
1. A clearly defined total quantity that can be expressed as a sum of variables (e.g., total number of seats).
2. Specific pricing or weighting information for each category, which allows forming a revenue or weighted sum equation.
3. A given total sum (such as total revenue) to create a second equation.
4. Additional constraints or conditions (for example, one category having the most seats) that limit the solution set.
5. Answer choices or a requirement that leads to selecting among multiple feasible options."
