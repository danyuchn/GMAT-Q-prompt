## Function
- Analyze the candidate's verbal explanation of their problem-solving process, point out mistakes, and provide suggestions for improvement, helping to solidify a consistent problem-solving strategy.

**Note:** Users can use voice recognition applications such as **Whisper Desktop** or **Mac Whisper** to convert their verbal problem-solving recordings into text.

## Suitable For
- Test takers whose problem-solving approaches in RC, CR, and TPA/MSR verbal sections are unclear.
- Beginners who need to establish a consistent method for solving problems.
- Candidates who wish to learn from their mistakes and refine their problem-solving logic.

## Example
**Input:**  

" A particular store has various cell phones in stock.

Of all cell phones in stock:
Most are sold at a discounted price if purchased with a new or renewed service contract.
More are dial pad phones (phones with integrated mechanical pads for entering numbers) than are touch screen-only phones (phones without integrated mechanical pads for entering numbers).

Of the dial pad phones:
Most have screens smaller than 8 centimeters (cm), measured diagonally.
Most are packaged with two or more accessories.

Of the touch screen-only phones:
Most have screens 8 cm or larger.
Most are packaged with two or more accessories.

Statement to be completed: Given the information regarding the cell phones in stock at the store, it follows that, of those that ___1___, fewer than half ___2___.

Based on the information provided, select for 1 and for 2 the options that most accurately complete the statement above. Make only two selections, one in each column.  
1	2	  
		are touch screen-only phones  
		have screens 8 cm or larger  
		are purchased without a service contract  
		are available at a discounted price with a service contract  
		are packaged with fewer than two accessories"  
  
"Alright, let’s tackle this question. So, I’ll first take a look at the problem. Uh, the question says something about using the info from the text. It’s talking about phones in a store, and then, uh, among the phones in the first category, less than half are in the second category. Okay, let me check the problem again. So, it says, uh, most of the phones are discounted, right? If you buy them with a contract, they’re discounted. And then it says most—well, even more phones—uh, first off, most phones are discounted with a contract. Then it says, uh, if they’re phones with keyboards, there are more of those—more keyboard phones than touchscreen ones. Alright, so that’s one part. 

Then the second part says, uh, most phones have screens smaller than 8 centimeters. And then keyboard phones, most of them come with 2 to 3 accessories. After that, it’s about touchscreen phones—touchscreen phones mostly have screens 8 centimeters or larger, and most of them also have, like, 2 to 3 accessories or more. Okay, cool. 

So, after reading this, let’s think it through again. We need to find a base group first, right? Like a total pool, and then figure out what ‘less than half’ refers to based on that. Alright, so based on the info in the text, the base group could either be all the phones, or maybe just the ones with keyboards, or maybe the touchscreen ones without keyboards, right? So, on the left side here, it’s gotta be either ‘touchscreen only’ or, uh, let’s see—maybe ‘with a contract’? No, I’m not sure about that one yet. 

Okay, then, uh, for this part, I think I’d first pick the touchscreen ones. And with touchscreen phones, the text says most of them have 2 to 3 accessories or more. So, let me see—kinda unsure here. If it’s touchscreen, then most of them should be bigger, right? So for the second part, I’d choose ‘half screens 8cm or larger.’ Alright, so my first pick is touchscreen phones, and the second is 8 centimeters or larger. Okay, I’m done with this question!"

**Output (Example):**  

**Analysis of the Candidate’s Verbal Explanation**

1. **Lack of Structured Organization**  
   The candidate’s explanation is informal and lacks a clear, systematic outline. Their reasoning process is interwoven with hesitations (e.g., “uh”, “I’m not sure”), which detracts from the overall clarity. A structured approach would involve:
   - **Explicitly listing the key facts** from the passage (e.g., proportions of phones with service contracts, screen sizes, accessory packages).
   - **Segmenting the explanation** by first identifying the base groups and then addressing the conditional relationships.

2. **Unclear Definition of the Base Group**  
   The statement “fewer than half” requires a clearly defined base group. The candidate is uncertain about whether the base group is “all phones,” “keyboard phones,” or “touchscreen phones.” A robust strategy would:
   - **Identify the primary categories** established by the passage (keyboard vs. touchscreen).
   - **Determine the relative proportions** based on the given “most” comparisons.
   - **Focus on eliminating irrelevant answer choices** by aligning them with the explicit information in the passage.

3. **Inconsistent Focus on Details**  
   The candidate’s process shifts focus between various aspects of the passage (discounted pricing, screen sizes, accessory counts) without tying them back to the question's requirement. They mention that “most phones are discounted” and the attributes of touchscreen phones, but do not connect these details to the “fewer than half” requirement in a methodical way.  
   - **Suggestion:** Concentrate on the specific attribute pairs in the answer choices. For example, analyze the proportion of touchscreen phones versus keyboard phones or screen sizes based on the provided facts.

4. **Vagueness in Reasoning and Answer Selection**  
   The explanation ends with a somewhat arbitrary decision: selecting “touchscreen phones” for column 1 and “screens 8 cm or larger” for column 2. This conclusion is reached without a detailed elimination process or justification.  
   - **Recommendation:** Use a step-by-step elimination strategy:
     - **Step 1:** Summarize the known facts (e.g., “More dial pad phones exist than touchscreen-only phones” and “Most touchscreen phones have screens 8 cm or larger”).
     - **Step 2:** Determine which subset would logically have “fewer than half” meeting a specific secondary characteristic.
     - **Step 3:** Justify each selection by referencing the passage’s quantitative comparisons.

5. **Improvement Through Structured Explanation**  
   To solidify a consistent problem-solving strategy, the candidate should:
   - **Outline the passage’s key quantitative relationships** before diving into answer selection.
   - **Clarify the definition of “most” and “fewer than half”** by quantifying them (e.g., more than 50% versus less than 50%) and then align each answer choice with these definitions.
   - **Eliminate answer choices** that conflict with the provided information, thereby narrowing the field before making a selection.
   - **Articulate and Summarize:** Conclude with a summary that reiterates why the chosen pair best completes the statement, ensuring every step is justified with reference to the passage.
   - **Practice Formal Language:** Reduce filler words and verbal hesitations. Use precise academic language to maintain clarity and professionalism in reasoning.

**Recommendations for Consistent Problem-Solving Strategy**

- **Establish a Clear Framework:**  
  Begin by identifying all relevant groups and their relationships. For example, create a mini-table to map out:
  - **Group A:** Dial pad phones (majority, screens < 8 cm, ≥2 accessories)  
  - **Group B:** Touchscreen-only phones (minority, screens ≥ 8 cm, ≥2 accessories)

- **Quantitative Reasoning:**  
  Focus on the implications of “most” and “fewer than half” using numerical thresholds. This aids in aligning the answer choices with the passage’s quantitative descriptions.

- **Elimination Process:**  
  Systematically rule out answer choices that conflict with the passage’s details. For instance, if “available at a discounted price with a service contract” applies to most phones, it cannot be part of a group where fewer than half have that characteristic.

- **Articulate and Summarize:**  
  Conclude with a summary that reiterates why the chosen pair best completes the statement, ensuring every step is justified with reference to the passage.

- **Practice Formal Language:**  
  Reduce filler words and verbal hesitations. Use precise academic language to maintain clarity and professionalism in reasoning.
